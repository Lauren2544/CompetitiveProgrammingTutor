<p class="paragraph"><b>Function calls</b><br>- Function: a named sequence of statements that perform a computation; once you have defined a function you can then call on it by name and it can return data as a result, we have already seen one example of a function by the name type, E.g. print(type(32))<br>
-   Python provides a number of important functions that we can use without needing to provide the function definition<br>
-   max() returns the largest value in a list or the largest character in a string<br>
-   abs()  returns the absolute value for a given input<br>
-   len() returns the amount of characters in a string or other sets of values<br>
-   int() returns the value as an integer <br><br>

<b>Creating a Function</b> <br>
-   Python functions are defined using the def keyword, E.g. def my_function(): print(‚ÄúHello‚Äù)<br><br>

<b>Calling a Function</b> <br>
-   To call a function use the functions name followed by parenthesis, E.g. my_function()<br><br>

<b>Fruitful and Void functions</b> <br>
-   Void function: a function that does not return a value, E.g. the function print_twice, performs an action but don‚Äôt return a value<br>
-   Fruitful function: a function that returns a value, when you call a fruitful function, you almost always want to do something with the result, <br>E.g. you might assign it to a variable or use it as part of an expression:<br> x = math.cos(radians)   <br>   golden = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2<br><br>

<b>Arguments</b> <br>
-   Argument: the value that is sent to the function when it is called<br>
-   Parameter: the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition<br>
-   The following example has a function with one argument (fname). When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name, <br>E.g. def my_function(fname): print(fname +‚ÄùRowe‚Äù) <br>my_function(‚ÄúTobias‚Äù)<br> my_function(‚ÄúLauren‚Äù)<br>
-   Please note that the number of arguments is also extremely important, if the function expects 2 arguments, you must call the function with 2 arguments, not more, not less, <br>E.g. def my_function(fname, lname): print(fname +‚Äù ‚Äù + lname) <br>my_function(‚ÄúLauren‚Äù, ‚ÄúRowe‚Äù)<br>
-   <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp">For more information make sure to check out this link</a> <br><br> 

<b>Math Functions</b> <br>
-   Python also has various math functions that can be imported from various modules, E.g. import math<br>
-   To access on of the functions within the module you would need to specify the name of the module and the name of the function separated by a dot, E.g. math.log10(3), or math.sin(0.7), or math.sqrt(math.pi) also note that math.pi is an approximation accurate to 15 digits of pi<br>

Mahima has been experimenting with a new style of art. She stands in front of a canvas and, using her brush, flicks drops of paint onto the canvas. When she thinks she has created a masterpiece, she uses her 3D printer to print a frame to surround the canvas.<br><br>

Your job is to help Mahima by determining the coordinates of the smallest possible rectangular frame such that each drop of paint lies inside the frame. Points on the frame are not considered inside the frame. E.g. The input below will output 23,9 and 65,79 on two different lines<br><br>5<br>44,62<br>34,69

For her birthday, Sandy got a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit, which is an electronic device she can use to track the local hiking trails. Along the way Sandy can mark waypoints that can be recorded on a map when she gets home. A description of each waypoint can be entered in the unit, however the device does not have a keypad. Instead it has four cursor buttons, up, down, left, and right, and a button to accept the letter. <br><br>
 
The screen displays a grid of the letters and symbols that can be used to "type out" the description. Here is the layout of the grid:<br><br>

A   B    C    D   E   F<br>
G   H    I    J   K   L<br>
M   N    O    P   Q   R<br>
S   T    U    V   W   X<br>
Y   Z  space  -   .  enter<br><br>
When you enter the name of the waypoint, the cursor starts at the A. You must move the cursor to the location of the next letter or symbol and then accept that letter. The cursor can only move to squares which are adjacent horizontally or vertically (not diagonally). Once you have entered all the letters in the description, you need to move the cursor to "enter" and accept the entire phrase.<br><br>

You are to write a program that will calculate the number of cursor movements it takes to "type in" a phrase. For example, to enter the word GPS, starting from the A position, you would move down 1 to select G, then move right 3 and down 1 to select P, then move down 1 and left 3 to select S and finally move down 1 and right 5 to select enter (e). This is a total of 15 cursor movements. Note that the total number of cursor movements does not change if you choose to move down and then across or across and then down. Also note that you cannot move beyond the boundaries of the grid (e.g., you cannot move off the grid nor "wrap-around" the grid). E.g. The input below will output GPS<br><br>15<br><br><a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc08j3">Click here for more information</a>

<p class="paragraph">

A simile is a combination of an adjective and noun that produces a phrase such as "Easy as pie" or "Cold as ice".<br><br>

Write a program to input ùëõ adjectives (1‚â§ùëõ‚â§5) and ùëö nouns (1‚â§ùëö‚â§5), and print out all possible similes. The first two lines of input will provide the values of ùëõ and ùëö, in that order followed, one per line, by ùëõ adjectives and ùëö nouns.
<br><br>
Your program may output the similes in any order. E.g. The input below will output Easy as pie, Easy as rock, Smart as pie, Smart as rock, Soft as pie, and Soft as rock each on a differnet line<br><br>3<br>2<br>Easy<br>Smart<br>Soft<br>pie<br>rock<br><br><a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc04j3">Click here for more information</a>
