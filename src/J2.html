<p class="paragraph"><b>Loops</b><br>
-   Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks, there are two different types of loops: for loops and while loops <br>
-   For loops are used when you know how many times the loop should run; it runs until it has run through as many iteration as there are items in the set <br>
-   While loops are used if you want the loop to break based on a condition other than the number of times it runs; it runs until some condition becomes false <br><br>

<b>While Loops</b> <br>
<u>Flow of execution: </u><br>1. Evaluate the condition yielding True or False<br> 2. If the condition is True the loop will execute the body and then go back to step one until the condition is false in which case the loop will be completed, it is important to note that if the variables in the loop are not incremented in the body of the loop this will create an infinite loop <br>
-   The break statements can also be used to stop the loop even if the condition is true<br>
-   Continue statements on the other hand can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next iteration<br>

<b>For Loops</b> <br>
<u>Flow of execution:</u><br>1. Checks if it is allowed to run through the first iteration <br>2. Runs through the first iteration <br>3. Checks if it is allowed to run through again if it is not the loop is complete <br>
-   The pass statement will skip over the for loop<br>
-   You can use nested loops where the ‚Äúinner loop‚Äù will be completely executed for each iteration of the ‚Äúouter loop‚Äù<br>
-   The range() function can also be used in for loops to set a range in which the for loop is allow to iterate to, E.g. for x in range(6): print (x, end=‚Äù ‚Äù) will print 0 1 2 3 4 5 <br>

<p class="paragraph">

People who study epidemiology use models to analyze the spread of disease. In this problem, we use a simple model.<br><br>

When a person has a disease, they infect exactly ùëÖ other people but only on the very next day. No person is infected more than once. We want to determine when a total of more than ùëÉ people have had the disease.<br><br>

(This problem was designed before the current coronavirus outbreak, and we acknowledge the distress currently being experienced by many people worldwide because of this and other diseases. We hope that including this problem at this time highlights the important roles that computer science and mathematics play in solving real-world problems. E.g.

            <div id="J2-button2008">

<p class="paragraph">
Those tiny music machines that play your digital music are really computers that keep track of and play music files. The CCC music player (C3MP) is currently in development and will be hitting the stores soon! In this problem, you have to simulate a C3MP.<br><br>

The C3MP music player will hold 5 songs in memory, whose titles will always be "A", "B", "C", "D" and "E". The C3MP also keeps track of a playlist, which is an ordering of all the songs. The C3MP has 4 buttons that the user will press to rearrange the playlist and play the songs.<br><br>

Initially, the C3MP playlist is "A, B, C, D, E". The 4 control buttons do the following:<br><br>

Button 1: move the first song of the playlist to the end of the playlist. For example: "A, B, C, D, E" will change to "B, C, D, E, A".<br>

Button 2: move the last song of the playlist to the start of the playlist. For example, "A, B, C, D, E" will change to "E, A, B, C, D".<br>

Button 3: swap the first two songs of the playlist. For example, "A, B, C, D, E" will change to "B, A, C, D, E".<br>

Button 4: stop rearranging songs and output the playlist.
You need to write a program to simulate a CCC music player. Your program should repeatedly ask for two positive integers ùëè and ùëõ. Here ùëè represents the button number that the user wants to press, 1‚â§ùëè‚â§4, and ùëõ represents the number of times that the user wants to press button ùëè. You can assume that ùëõ always satisfies 1‚â§ùëõ‚â§10.<br><br>

The input will always finish with the pair of inputs (ùëè=4, ùëõ=1) when this happens, you should print the order of songs in the current playlist and your program should end. You can assume that the user will only ever press button 4 once. E.g. The input below will output B C D A E<br><br>2<br>1<br>3<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>1<br><br><a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc08j2">Click here for more information</a>
