            <div id="J1-button">
<p class="paragraph"><b>Variables</b><br>
- One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables<br>
- A variable is a name that refers to a value<br>
- Variable names can consist of a-z characters, 0-9 numbers, and underscores and are usually mnemonic E.g. pizza, slices = 3, 5 (this will mean the variable with the name pizza equals 3 and slices equals 5)<br>
- If you put a space in a variable name, or start with a number you will get a SyntaxError<br>
- Python also has 35 keywords reserved and these cannot be variable names: and, del, from, None, True, as, elif, global, nonlocal, try, assert, else, if, not, while, break, except, import, or, with, class, False, in, pass, yield, continue, finally, is, raise, async, def, for, lambda, return, await<br><br>

<b>Values and Types</b><br>
- In programming there are many different types of variables, these variables include text, numeric, sequence, mapping, set, Boolean, and binary types<br>- If you are not sure what type a value has, the id can tell you, E.g. print(type(“Hello World”))<br>
- You can also set a variable to a specific type, E.g. x=input(int(5))<br>
<u>Text type:</u> <br>--> string (you can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotations)<br> <u>Numeric types:</u> <br>--> integers <br>--> floats (decimal numbers) <br>--> complex numbers (have a real and imaginary part, which are each a floating-point number)<br>
<u>Sequence Types: </u><br>--> list (used to store data, constructed with square brackets, separating items with commas: [a,b.c]) <br>--> tuple (used to store data, constructed with round brackets, unidexed and unmalleable; does allow duplicates) <br>
<u>Mapping Type:</u> <br>--> dictionaries (used to store data values in value pairs, E.g. this dict = {“brand”: “Ford”, “model”: Mustang}) <br>
<u>Set Type: </u><br>--> set (used to store data in and unordered, not repeating and unindexed way meaning the order will change every time you print the set)<br>
<u>Boolean Types:</u> <br> -->  Boolean values (used to check if a expression is True or False, E.g. print(10>9))<br><br>

<b>Statements </b><br>
- Statement: a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute<br>
- If statement: if the statement is true then the python id will execute the code <br>
- Elif statement: if the pervious conditions were not true, then try this condition<br>
- Else statement: if the previous conditions weren’t met then the id will execute the code from the else statement<br><br>

<b>Operators</b> <br>
- Fun fact: the + and * operators work for strings, Example one: print(“hello”+”cat”) >>> hellocat, Example two: print(3*”cat”) >>> catcatcat<br>
- Remember that 1/2*pi will evaluate to pi/2<br>
- <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp">Click here for extra information about python operators</a> <br><br>

<b>Asking the User for input</b><br>
- Sometimes it is very helpful to ask the user for input, E.g. x=input() <br><br>

<b>Comments</b><br>
- Comments are used so other people reading your code can understand it better<br>
- Single line comments start with a #, and Python will ignore them, E.g. #this is a comment<br>
- Multiple line comments start and end with “”” and they are used to ignore multiple lines of code

  Barley the dog loves treats. At the end of the day he is either happy or sad depending on the number and size of treats he receives throughout the day. The treats come in three sizes: small, medium, and large. His happiness score can be measured using the following formula: 1 × small treat + 2 × medium treat + 3 × large treat. <br><br>If Barley’s happiness score is 10 or greater then he is happy. Otherwise, he is sad. Determine whether Barley is happy or sad at the end of the day. <br><br> There are three lines of input. Each line contains a non-negative integer less than 10. The first line contains the number of small treats, S, the second line contains the number of medium treats, M, and the third line contains the number of large treats, L, that Barley receives in a day. E.g.The input below will output sad<br><br>3<br>0<br>1<br><br><a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc20j1">Click here for more information</a>

            <div id="J1-button2018">

<p class="paragraph">
   Here at the Concerned Citizens of Commerce (CCC), we have noted that telemarketers like to use seven-digit phone numbers where the last four digits have three properties. Looking just at the last four digits, these properties are:<br><br>

the first of these four digits is an 8 or 9;<br>
the last digit is an 8 or 9;<br>
the second and third digits are the same.<br><br>
For example, if the last four digits of the telephone number are 8229, 8338, or 9008, these are telemarketer numbers.<br><br>

Write a program to decide if a telephone number is a telemarketer number or not, based on the last four digits. If the number is not a telemarketer number, we should answer the phone, and otherwise, we should ignore it. E.g. The input below will output ignore. <br><br>9<br>6<br>6<br>8<br><br><a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc18j1">Click here for more information</a>

<p class="paragraph">
   A common problem in mathematics is to determine which quadrant a given point lies in. <br><br>

tFor example, the point 𝐴, which is at coordinates (12,5) lies in quadrant 1 since both its 𝑥 and 𝑦 values are positive, and point 𝐵 lies in quadrant 2 since its 𝑥 value is negative and its 𝑦 value is positive.<br><br>
the second and third digits are the same.<br><br>Your job is to take a point and determine the quadrant it is in. You can assume that neither of the two coordinates will be 0.
