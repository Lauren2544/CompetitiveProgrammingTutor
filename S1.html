Trick E. Dingo is trying, as usual, to catch his nemesis the Street Sprinter. His past attempts using magnets, traps and explosives have failed miserably, so he's catching his breath to gather observational data and learn more about how fast Street Sprinter is.<br><br>

Trick E. Dingo and Street Sprinter both inhabit a single straight west-east road with a particularly famous rock on it known affectionately as The Origin. Positions on this straight road are measured numerically according to the distance from The Origin, using negative numbers for positions west of The Origin and positive numbers for positions east of The Origin.<br><br>

The observations by Trick E. Dingo each contain two numbers: a time, and the value of Street Sprinter's position on the road at that time. Given this information, what speed must Street Sprinter be capable of? E.g. The input below will output 7.0<br><br>3<br>0 100<br>20 50

You are trying to pass the time while at the optometrist. You notice there is a grid of four numbers:<br><br>
1 2<br>
3 4<br><br>

You see lots of mirrors and lenses at the optometrist, and wonder how flipping the grid horizontally or vertically would change the grid.<br><br>

Specifically, a "horizontal" flip (across the horizontal centre line) would take the original grid of four numbers and result in:<br><br>
3 4<br>
1 2<br><br>

A "vertical" flip (across the vertical centre line) would take the original grid of four numbers and result in:<br><br>
2 1 <br>
4 3<br><br>

Your task is to determine the final orientation of the numbers in the grid after a sequence of horizontal and vertical flips. E.g. The input below will output 4 3 and 2 1 on different lines<br><br>HV<br><br><a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc19S1">Click here for more information</a>

<p class="paragraph">
In the country of Voronoi, there are 𝑁 villages, located at distinct points on a straight road. Each of these villages will be represented by an integer position along this road.<br><br>

Each village defines its neighbourhood as all points along the road which are closer to it than to any other village. A point which is equally close to two distinct villages 𝐴 and 𝐵 is in the neighbourhood of 𝐴 and also in the neighbourhood of 𝐵.<br><br>

Each neighbourhood has a size which is the difference between the minimum (leftmost) point in its neighbourhood and the maximum (rightmost) point in its neighbourhood.<br><br>

The neighbourhoods of the leftmost and rightmost villages are defined to be of infinite size, while all other neighbourhoods are finite in size.<br><br>

Determine the smallest size of any of the neighbourhoods (with exactly 1 digit after the decimal point). E.g. The input below will output 3.0<br><br>5<br>16<br>0<br>10<br>4<br>15<br><br><a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc18S1">Click here for more information</a>

Annie has two favourite baseball teams: the Swifts and the Semaphores. She has followed them throughout the season, which is now over. The season lasted for 𝑁 days. Both teams played exactly one game on each day.<br><br>

For each day, Annie recorded the number of runs scored by the Swifts on that day. She also recorded this information for the Semaphores.<br><br>

She would like you to determine the largest integer 𝐾 such that 𝐾≤𝑁 and the Swifts and the Semaphores had scored the same total number of runs 𝐾 days after the start of the season. The total number of runs scored by a team after 𝐾 days is the sum of the number of runs scored by the team in all games before or on the 𝐾-th day.<br><br>

For example, if the Swifts and the Semaphores have the same total number of runs at the end of the season, then you should output 𝑁. If the Swifts and the Semaphores never had the same number of runs after 𝐾 games, for any value of 𝐾≤𝑁, then output 0.

<p class="paragraph">
Your boss has asked you to add up a sequence of positive numbers to determine how much money your company made last year.<br><br>

Unfortunately, your boss reads out numbers incorrectly from time to time.<br><br>

Fortunately, your boss realizes when an incorrect number is read and says "zero", meaning "ignore the current last number."<br><br>

Unfortunately, your boss can make repeated mistakes, and says "zero" for each mistake.<br><br>

For example, your boss can say "One, three, five, four, zero, zero, seven, zero, zero, six", which means the total is 7 as explained in the following chart.<br><br>

At any point, your boss will have said at least as many positive numbers as "zero" statements. If all positive numbers have been ignored, the sum is zero.<br><br>

Write a program that reads the sequence of boss statements and computes the correct sum. E.g. The input below will output 0<br><br>4<br>3<br>0<br>4<br>0<br><br><a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc15S1">Click here for more information</a>
