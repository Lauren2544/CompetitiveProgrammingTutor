## Welcome to your Competitive Programming Tutor!

The Competitive Programming Tutor was built in html and css to help teach you the basics of competitive programming. This website can be used as a solution manual to use while studing for the Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) - a competition run by the University of Waterloo with the goal of teaching high school students how to code!

I was just learning C while making this website so the C solutions are not entirely complete. But for the problems I did solve in both C and Python, it was fun to see how much faster the C versions ran!

### How It Works
Navigate to the problem section you want (J1 is easiest, S3 is hardest).
Read the problem and try to solve!
If you get stuck check the "click here for more information" for hints.
Finally take a look at the solution.
### Lessons Learned
C is so so so much faster than python.
Creating a website aimed at teaching others also helped me learn.
### Known Bugs
The "contact us" form does not work.
There are only limited problems solved in C.
